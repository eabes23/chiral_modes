# chiral_modes

This repository is designed to provide sample data that supports the findings in the paper "Quantifying the Chirality of Vibrational Modes in Helical Molecular Chains." 

The files "4-twist.pdb", etc. are .pdb files for sample structures representative of those examined in Figure 1 of the paper. The files "4-twist-modes.zip", etc. are folders containing the coordinates for all of the normal modes of the corresponding structures in .xyz format. 

Requests for further analysis codes and other inquiries should be directed to Ethan Abrhaham (email: ethana@mit.edu).
